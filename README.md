SQweb Drupal Module
===

**This Module allows you to easily integrate SQweb on your Drupal powered website.**

##Requirements

**This Module has been tested with PHP 5.5 and greater and with Drupal 8.22 and greater.**

We are unable to provide official support for earlier versions. For more information about end of life PHP branches, [see this page](http://php.net/supported-versions.php).

##Install

Settings your SQweb Website ID and your language on your Drupal administration, on SQweb section. 

##Usage

###1. Tagging your pages

The SQweb script is add to all your pages after you configure your SQweb Website ID (Ref: Install).

###2. Checking the credits of your subscribers

SQweb add a lot of filter and function to Twig for simplify usage of sqweb in your Theme.

Use it like this:

```php
{% if sqw_abo() %}
	//CONTENT
{% else %}
	//ADS
{% endif %}
```

###3. Showing the Multipass button

Finally, use this code to display the Multipass button on your pages:

```php
{{ sqw_button() }}
```

If you want to use a smaller version of the Multipass button, you can by using this line:

```php
{{ sqw_button('slim') }}
```

###4. More functions


#### Display only a part of your content to non premium users

```php
{{ 'Your content' | sqw_transpartext(percent) }}
```
`percent` is the percent of your content you want to display to everyone.

Example:

```php
{{ 'one two three four' | sqw_transpartext( 50 ) }}
```

Will display for free users:

```
one two
```

#### Display your content later for non paying users

```php
{{ 'Your content' | sqw_waittodisplay(publication_date, wait) }}
```

1. `publication_date` is the date when your content is published on your website.
2. `wait` is the number of day you want to wait before showing this content to free users.

Example:

```php
{{ 'Put your content here' | sqw_waittodisplay('2016/10/01', 3) }}
```

#### Limit the number of articles free users can read per day

```php
{{ 'Your content' | sqw_limitarticle(numbers_of_articles) }}
```

`number_of_articles` is the number of articles a free user can see.

For instance, if I want to display only 5 articles to free users:

```php
{{ 'Your content' | sqw_limitarticle(5) }}
```
